# Electric Bus Charging Optimization: Q-Learning vs. Manual Strategy

This project demonstrates the optimization of electric bus battery charging using both a Q-Learning-based reinforcement learning algorithm and a conventional manual (rule-based) strategy. The goal is to minimize charging costs and extend battery life based on real-world operational and traffic data.

## Features
- Implementation of Q-Learning for dynamic battery charging decision-making
- Baseline manual charging logic for comparison
- Data-driven simulation based on real bus route and schedule
- Evaluation metrics: energy savings, battery cycles, charging cost, and SoC (State of Charge) statistics

## Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optionally: TensorFlow/Keras if deep RL is included)
